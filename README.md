I have been given permission by the instructors to make this work public.

## Project 1
Using SQL to manipulate a data table. This changed column names and changed the values inside of the columns based on conditional statements. New columns were also created and age was binned.

## Project 2
This project used R to perform manipulations on a data table. Databases were merged together and columns values in columns were grouped by. The results were graphed using ggplot.

## Midterm Project
An unclean dataset from NHANES was given to us and asked to be cleaned. The dataset was cleaned by removing NA's and correcting column types as well creating a data dictionary for the new columns.

## Final Project
A csv was merged with an sql dataset. The dataset was manipulated to answer certain questions. 
Datasets were merged in R and in SQL.
